## ðŸ‘· Problem We Are Trying to Solve ðŸ‘·
When navigating entrepreneurship, women often face gender-specific challenges in the industry such as gender bias, lack of capital (data shows that women-owned businesses are less likely to receive funding), and confidence issues due to the lack of female representation in the industry. 

While mentorship programs exist to alleviate these frustrations, women are often underserved as non-customized or tailor-fitted mentorship programs **cannot grasp the nuances of the gender gaps between cis-men and women/gender-diverse people.** These nuances affect people's decision-making and should be taken into account when providing professional guidance.

## ðŸ”¨ What it does ðŸ”¨
Insightful is a mentorship platform that connects mentees and mentors from the women and gender-diverse community. Using **vector similarity search**, Insightful matches mentees with prospective mentors that share the same goals - expertise, industry, and personal background.
